                            <p><b><font size="4">Mutual support for the elderly</font></b></p>
                            <p><b><font size="4">Fallen leaves return to the roots 一to revert to one's origin.</font></b></p>
                            <p>Both a children' 5 world and retirement paradise, Turtle Home allows the elderly and children to live together with ease. The design considered the situations of different families, and family mutual assistance is used to create a family space of collective life for the elderly. The house design uses a multilayered shell system to create a courtyard space that surrounds an inside living space. Taking both the shell system and the longevity-centric perception of turtles in Chinese culture, the house was named Turtle Home in English and 归家in Chinese. 1)王家was chosen because it sounds similar to the Chinese word for turtle, with the meaning of "returning home." With the houses emphasis on the elderly and retirement, the names 归家and Turtle Home were chosen.</p>

                            <p><b style="color: #87CEEB"><font size="4">Home is the Focal Destination</font></b></p>
                            <p>Taking traditional Chinese culture into account, a traditional Chinese idiom is central to the focus of our house design. "Falling leaves return to their roots" is an idiom used to describe returning to one' 5 hometown andjor family. Eventually returning home is the choice of many, and Turtle Home seeks to capitalize on that. Embracing the age-old idea that raising children fights against old, Turtle Home creates an environment that allows children to easily live with their grandparents. Considering that home is at the center of both retirement and childhood, the young and old are a perfect match.</p>
                            <p><b style="color: #FFC125"><font size="4">Children Bring Life</font></b></p>
                            <p>A symbiotic relationship, both children and the elderly benefit each other. Lively children keep the elderly company, helping reduce loneliness, a problem endemic among retirees.Additionally, grandparents impart experience and knowledge to the child, satisfying their curiosity and thirst for knowledge.</p>

                            <p>On February 26, 2015, the National Bureau of Statistics of China issued the Statistical Communique on National Economic and Social Development in 2014. According to the Communique, at the end of 2014, the number of people over the age of 60 in China was 212.4 million, accounting for 15.5% of the total population; the population over the age of 65 was 137.55 million, accounting for 10.1 %, exceeding 10% for the first time. The aging problem has caught China by surprise. The problem has been raised to the strategic height of the development of the count叩and well-being of the Chinese people."</p>
                            <p><b><font size="4">Design Subject</font></b></p>
                            <p>We are designing a low-rise villa for around the city and suburb to create a comfortable, quiet, and convenient green community for the elderly. Through the combination of the elderly villa community and the smart home, the quality and comfort of the house can be improved by using solar energy.</p>
                            <p><b style="color: #87CEEB"><font size="4">Adapting to Changing Demographics for Mutual Assistance</font></b></p>
                            <p>The Chinese family model is changing, creating problems for the traditional model of elderly care. Historically the Chinese elderly care model has been family based, with families taking care of their older counterparts. Multiple children would care for their parents and grandparents in old age. With the implementation of China' 5 One Child Policy family sizes across China have gotten smaller. Going into the future one child will be tasked with providing for six other people, in addition to their own families. This is known as the 4-2-1 problem; only children will be tasked with supporting both of their parents and potentially all four grandparents, as they will have no siblings to help care for their aging family members. These smaller families will not be able to take care of the elderly as effectively as larger families have in the past. A lot of families cannot bear the cost of caring for their seniors, and this problem will continue to grow.</p>
                            <p>Although various pension institutions can solve the problem of old-age care, this model has huge social costs and severe resource consumption. The vast majority of elderly people are accustomed to living with the family and are reluctant to go to nursing homes. Nursing homes are often lonely and uncomfortable compared to living at home.Considering various situation of different families,we are using the mutual assistance to build a domestic space for elderly people.</p>

                            <p>In the middle of the living shell a garden shell is introduced,providing for further access to the fresh air and sunlight..Just as a turtle finds its shelter andsafety within its shell our home is comprised of an outer shell with an inside living area. Our design concept brings the beauty of nature indoors and brings the function and comfort of indoors to the outside.</p>

                            <p>The naturallighting design takes energy saving, aesthetic modeling, space needs and lighting needs all into account, providing residents with a comfortable, energy saving and beautiful experience. Diffuse natural light is introduced through the top windows. With uniform light coming from the top of the house, the design provides residents with more than enough light within the courtyard. A courtyard set in the middle of the indoor living space allows for the introduction of light into house itself, providing a more than adequate amount of indoor light. The courtyard aspect to the house design creates a space that is both indoors and outdoors, creating a seamless transition between indoors and outdoors. The smooth transition between living space and outdoor space allows the design to perfectly integrate the natural environment with natural light.</p>
