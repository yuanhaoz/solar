                            <p>The low-key and minimalist design can maximize the integration of the building into the surrounding environment, so that the building can beUer play its role as a "service provider". At the same time, abandoning the exaggerated and unnecessary decoration can also reduce the cost and further enhance the market competitiveness.</p>
                            <p><b><font size="3">Beautiful landscape/优美的景观</font></b></p>
                            <p>A large number of window holes in the building facade can bring the beautiful scenery out of the room to achieve the harmony and unity of indoor and outdoor space. The change of opening windows also enriches the space experience of the building, and can increase the enjoyment of life for the users. In addition, the existence of the inner courtyard not only rovides a good light source for the interior, but also rovides help for ventilation and ventilation. It also eliminates the sense of obstruction in the indoor space.</p>

                            <p>The function is complete. In type, the building has a garage, living room, dining room, toilet, kitchen, home office, equipment room and three different bedrooms. In quantity, the size of each room is very spacious. In addition, almost every room is equipped with a toilet.</p>
                            <p>User friendly design. Our main target is retired or retiring old people, so barrier free design is very necessary. For example, a ramp is installed at the entrance of the building to facilitate wheelchair access. The size of the bathroom should meet the rotation radius of the wheelchair and so on.</p>

                            <p>We built a semi outdoor grey space by adding a box with holes to the outside of the building. Such a gray space can encourage outdoor activities. There are almost 300 days of sunshine in a year, which is very important for outdoor experience. AII these shady places encourage residents to spend more time outdoors. The most important thing is that our target customers can directly touch fresh air and natural elements, and have a sense of shelter and safety indoors. When entertaining guests, openness helps indoor and outdoor entertainment.</p>

                            <p>Lighting design:We make full use of natural light and have natural lighting in every corner of the room. The box outside the building is cleverly open at the top, providing ample vertical lighting for all space that requires sufficient sunlight, such as the elderly bedroom and the living room.</p>
                            <p>Many important physical functions depend on its sleep wakefulness cycle, hormone release and temperature. With natural and healthy rhythm, home design can prevent many diseases. Our design is trying to reduce obesity, diabetes, depression and other seasonal affective disorders.

                            <h2><b style="color: rgb(0, 135, 146)">MARKET POTENTIAL</b></h2>
                            <hr>
                            <p><b style="color: #FFC125"><font size="4">Buildability</font></b></p>
                            <p>Rural village design has begun to change, and it is suggested that this is linked to the changes to administrative hierarchies and policies, which have released the villages and their occupants from the previous restrictions. It is therefore a very opportune to build homes in rural areas. Much research, thought and consideration about traditional Chinese rural housing was put into designing the turtle home, so it is without problem or delay that a contractor is able to construct our home as we envisioned.</p>
                            <p>All the house' s materials and equipment are commercially available, such that the house can be immediately built where desired. The drawings and construction specifications provided sufficient quality and detail that enabled our contracting company to both generate an accurate, detailed construction cost estimate and to pre-construct the building as our design team intended it to be built.</p>
                            <p><b><font size="3">Highly Recommended and Competitive Gypsum Building Solutions</font></b></p>
                            <p>Due to its adaptability, and ease of attaining and using , gypsum building systems are highly recommended as very competitive as it acts as an efficient solution associated with buildings that have low energy consumption.</p>
                            <p>In the Turtle home our outer walls and inner wall are installed with high strength high pressure plasterboard and gypsum blocks, which replace the old and tired way of using steel framework. This application is based on a plug and socket technique without plaster and girdles, thus economizing assembly costs and cutting construction time.</p>
                            <p>There are many other advantages to using this material such as; it is non-flammable, sound absorbing, bio-degradable, possesses high mechanical strength and thermal mass, has high water and moisture resistance, , and is manufactured by an environmentally friendly process Gypsum blocks are the new and preferred choice of engineers, architects and contractors alike.</p>
                            <p><b><font size="3">Windows</font></b></p>
                            <p>"As you have seen the Turtle home is overflowing with an abundance of windows.</p>
                            <p>Triple pane windows are used in the construction of our home as they are an exciting step up from double glazed windows, having 3 panes of glass and 2 spacers instead of one. Though they are much heavier and slightly more expensive than double panes windows their popularity has come from the great difference in performance. With triple pane windows there is a 20-30% improvement in energy rating. Also the spacers in 3 pane windows are made differently than the warm edges spaces used in the average pane window. They use a superior quality silicone that is resistant to UV light oxidation and offers great argon gas retention for higher energy efficiency. Also with having 3 pane windows there is a significant reduction in outdoor noise pollution. Triple pane windows are available everywhere and are installed just the same.</p>

                            <p><b style="color: #FFC125"><font size="4">Target Clients</font></b></p>
                            <p>Our Target population is the retired and retiring urban wage earners. The Turtle Home is multifunctional and brings a modern twist to traditional Chinese rural homes. The design provides amenities to meet the needs for all ages. For many older couples, the leisurely and pastoral life is more appealing than the noisy and fast paced city life.</p>
                            <p>Urbanization in China is happening very quickly. For the elderly who have worked in the city for several decades and are about to retire, we take an excerpt from a famous traditional poem that describes "Collecting chrysanthemums and admiring the Nanshan Mountains" being the dream that many Chinese people hope to achieve.</p>
