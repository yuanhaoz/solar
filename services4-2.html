                            <hr>
                            <p>The population in China is constantly on an upward trend, and to keep up with that
trend it is time to start investing in building and improving rural communities. The
package of initiatives to refocus development in rural areas was announced in early
2006 under the banner of 飞reating a new socialist countryside" [19]. This change
seemed to recognize both the importance of the countryside and rural areas to complement
the urban development that was taking place and to recognize that not every
citizen would live in cities. These policies and advice could be focused on the future environmental
sustainability of villages and act to support the long-term self-reliance and
self-support mechanisms that are more appropriate. Along with rural development
issues the Chinese elderly community is struggling. The one-child policy has created a
large age gap that has left many senior citizens alone, in improper living conditions, or
without housing opportunities at al l.</p>
<p>The development and success of rural areas is needed on a national level, to not only
sustain current areas but to also support neighboring urban areas. In China a majority
of parents work in the city while the elderly watches their grandchildren. Urban areas
are so congested that city living is overly expensive, which leave the elderly in poor
living conditions or even homeless.</p>
<p>
    According to the United Nations, China is ageing more rapidly than almost any country
in recent history. China' s dependency ratio for retirees could rise as high as 44% by
2050. The dependency ratio compares the difference between those
not in the labor force with those who are working, or can work full-time. Urbanization
in China is happening very quickly leaving a large elderly housing problem. In turn we
comprised a plan to build affordable communities outside of city and suburb areas to
create peaceful, comfortable, and sustainable green communities for them. For many
older couples, the leisurely and peaceful life is more aUractive than the noisy and fast
paced city life.

                            <p><b><font size="4">Team Logo</font></b></p>
                            <p>The logo is a combination of ideas that our design wants to convey. The design
philosophy combines a simplified outline of our home along with our house name
in both English and Chinese characters 11 归(~需)家11 and the colleges that make
up our team. We are an International team made up of 3 universities from 3 continents.
Xi' an Jiatong University of China, Western New England University of the
United States and Politech University of Milan Italy. The Chinese Name of our
house is called ll Gua Jia ll which means IIReturning Homell , The English name of
our house is the IITurtle Homell , which turtle has the same pronunciation in Chinese
as the character IIGuall
heaven, and represents longevity.</p>
                            <p><b><font size="4">Informational Signage</font></b></p>
                            <p>The layout of our exhibition
boards is concise with the
theme prominently displayed.
AS it stands the spirit of the
competition is closely integrated
with the current trend of
national development going
green. The exhibition boards
will display our team introduction,
express our design
themes, and promote our
house description.。</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Exhibit Swag</font></b></p>
<p>Along with informative signage, we put together
some creative marketing strategies.
To help keep visitors cool we will be handing
out circular fans that market our design concept
and are printed with a tour map of our
home. We will also be handing out personal
time capsules on the back of each fan so that
guests can write something they want to say
to friends or loved ones. We will collect all
the time capsules and return them back to
the visitors in 10 years. In Chinese traditional
culture it is believe that fallen leaves
return to the roots meaning to revert to
one' s origins. The design concept of II re -
turning homell is strengthened through the
form of the time capsules.</p>

                            <p><b><font size="4">Project Highlights</font></b></p>
                            <p>1.) The design of the home consists of 3 components;
At the heart of the home lies the court yard, some of the many benefits of
this include increasing naturallighting, optimization of solar gains and more
cross-ventilation.</p>
                            <p>The inner shell that surrounds the courtyard is enclosed and entails all of the
homes living spaces. Even though it is closed off from the outdoor elements
there is still plenty of natural light as the house has many windows and an
open layout.</p>
                            <p>The last component is the outer shell which is open to the outside environment.
This shell includes and an area surrounding the house which provides
a cool and comfortable place for outdoor activities and a spacious second
floor which is designed to be a children' s play space.</p>
                            <p>2.) CL cast in place composite gypsum concrete will be used to construct the
frame of our house. There are many other advantages to using this material
such as; it is non-flammable, sound absorbing, bio-degradable, possesses
high mechanical strength and thermal mass, has high water and moisture
resistance, and is manufactured by an environmentally friendly process</p>
                            <p>3.) The smart home technology has 3 major design components. The first
being comfort and convenience. The second component is energy monitoring
and clean energy consumption distribution. The last component is elderly
safety and security for comfortable living.</p>
<p>to create a comfortable, quiet, and convenient green retirement community
for the elderly to provide for the elderly.</p>

                            <p><b><font size="4">Guide Tour</font></b></p>
                            <p>1.)The tour will route is split into stations so that guests are able to visit and learn about
all key elements of the Turtle Homes design. Each tour station will be clearly labeled and
contain visual media distinguishing them from each other. Along with signage each station
will contain a QR code for visitors to scan with their mobile phones to obtain a more
comprehensive description surrounding each station including innovations, materials,
sponsors and more.</p>
                            <p>2.)We will be distributing marketing swag such as brochures printed on fans to our
guests during the tours. This not only serves as a descriptive function but also provides
our visitors relief from the heat during the scorching summer season. To make the tour
more interesting visitors will have the opportunity to write messages and put them in our
time capsule.</p>
                            <p>3.)For the tour we will have interactive demonstrations for the visitors to participate in
have a hands-on experience. The interaction will include but are not limited to a cross
sectional area of our CL wall for visitors to understand our building materials, the use of
the QR code will also enter guests into our on-site lottery encouraging participation and
enhancing enthusiasm, Specific selfie areas and hashtags throughout the house that
highlight different amenities and give our guest another opportunity to enter the lottery,
and demonstrations that show the real time energy usage and consumption monitoring.</p>
                            <p>4.)When queuing to enter the house, we will provide guest with shading, water, and
small souvenirs to improve their visiting experience.</p>

                            <p><b><font size="4">Tour route design</font></b></p>
                            <p>The design of the tour route is as long as possible and is connected in series so that visitors
can visit the home as fully as possible to get a comprehensive understanding of our house.
Taking the first floor as an example, we designed 4 important visiting sections, namely the
outdoor platform, elderly bedroom, courtyard, and traditional room. Each section represents
a highlighted feature of the home. During the tour, team members will be placed
at each highlighted area to provide a descriptive explanation for the visitors at that node.
We have taken initiative to plan for high traffic times. The 2 things taken into consideration
are as follows;</p>
                            <p>1.)High traffic was taken into consideration when planning the tour route to provide the
longest path. The width of the tour channel is relatively spacious, hands on demonstrations
will help alleviated over crowdedness by keeping visitors entertained allowing more time
for congestion to clear out.</p>
                            <p>2.)ln times of high traffic, we have
planned for time-scheduled appointments
and reservations for
groups to control the flow of
people in each time period, allowing
only a fixed number of visitors
to enter in each time period. Also,
the design and use of QR codes
allow us to also allow for independent
house tours without tour
guides needed. Appointments and
reservatinns will o_nly be_ imple.;;
mented in times of uncontrollable
