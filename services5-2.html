the house.</p>
                            <p>• Rain water collects at the North side of the house and filters to the garden and
courtyard, to water the plants in the court yard and south side of the house.</p>
                            <p>• Grey water is collected in the North East corner of the house from the sinks and
shower pipes and then filtered to the rainwater collection where it is also distributed
to the house plants.</p>

                            <p>• Over time these functions will aid in the conservation and repurpose of thousands
of gallons of water while improving the quality of livening within the home.</p>
                            <p>• These strategies may influence other housing designs in the future to include a rain
and grey water systems as well as conservative shower heads in efforts to recycle
water efficiently and improving the standards of living within a more versatile home,
ultimately attracting potential buyers.</p>
                            <p>• Rain and grey water systems within the house can boost the market potential immensely
for it improves aesthetics of effected gardens, plants, and ultimately the
home a whole.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Advantages</font></b></p>
                            <p>Setting up water reusal systems will
effectively use and save limited, valuable,
freshwater resources. These
water reusal systems will also reduce
the amount of pollutants and wastewater
discharged, and can also relieve
the overload phenomenon of
urban sewers. These water reusal
systems have obvious social, environmental,
and economic benefits.</p>

                            <p>• The house has a 640w electrostatic dust removal heat exchanger which removes fine
particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air in the house.</p>
                            <p>• There is a 500w central air conditioning system with six outputs installed throughout
the design of the house. The smart home feature connects with the central air and adj
usts the system based on the weather, humidity, and other situations to assure the be
st quality of living without wasting any extra energy.</p>
                            <p>• The surplus of windows that open and close throughout the house, also allows for a
large variety of air circulation variables that can regulate air flow and improve air qual
ity according to varying situations.</p>
<p>• Plants are also being suited to the home based on their abilities to best affect the air
quality.</p>
<p>• The smart air conditioning system, the purposeful of greenery, the air purifying syste
m,and ventilation via windows provide the perfect living situation for fresh air circulati

                            <p>• The mechanical system employs a reversible water-to-water heat pump that provides
hot and cold water to hydronic radiant systems for space conditioning, and provides
all domestic hot water for the home with no backup. When in cooling mode, the
equipment employs a desuperheater to harvest some waste heat for domestic water
heating. The heat pump also utilizes an innovative low-cost in-ground heat exchanger
that costs a fraction of conventional ground-source approaches, and which recovers
heat from greywater.</p>
                            <p>• Grey water from the home flows around the outside of these heat exchangers, increasing
thermal conductivity year round, and augmenting the effective ground temperature
in the winter.</p>
